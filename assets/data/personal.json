            "I’m Rahul Krishnan, a Data Science student at Universität Trier, Germany, with a background in Computer Science and over three years of software development experience at SAP Labs India. My work bridges data-driven machine learning solutions and scalable deployment practices.",
            "I enjoy building end-to-end AI systems—from model training to production deployment. Recently, I developed and deployed an Amazon Electronics Recommender System using FAISS and a Two-Tower MLP, served via FastAPI and Azure Container Apps. I’ve also worked on a Transformer-based sentiment analysis API using BERT, Docker, and CI/CD pipelines on GitHub Actions.",
            "My interests include recommender systems, natural language processing, and MLOps. I’m passionate about building reliable, well-documented, and reproducible machine learning solutions that can scale beyond experimentation."
